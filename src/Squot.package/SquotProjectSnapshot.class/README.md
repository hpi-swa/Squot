I am a snapshot of a project and its artifacts, taken from a SquotProjectStore. After an artifact has been accessed through me, I will answer the same SquotArtifactSnapshot for this artifact later even if the contents in the store have changed. Thus, you should use me if you want to avoid that snapshots of the artifacts are captured repeatedly, or if you cannot handle that artifacts change concurrently during the operation that you want to perform. (But note that I do not guarantee that concurrent modifications of an artifact while a snapshot of it is being taken will not cause problems. I am not a thread-safety device.)

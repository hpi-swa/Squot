I am a tool that lets a user edit the properties of a new Version.

Instance Variables
	canceled:		<Boolean or nil> the operation is assumed to be cancelled unless #accept has been called and this is false
	changeChooser:	<SquotChangedArtifactsChooser>
	message:		<String> log message for the new version

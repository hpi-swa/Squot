I coordinate a revert of an ancestor version of the working copy. A revert undoes the changes introduced by another version relative to its (or one of its) parents. This creates a new version on the current historian. Therefore a revert is composed of a merge and a save operation. It is very similar to a cherry-pick, the main difference being that the base version and the incoming version of the merge are swapped.
